This is a plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft server.

This plugin adds an item and pack listing for users to access. The
/want and /grant commands allow players to receive and give
(respectively) items by a number of names and easy-to-remember
aliases.

Items are categorized into groups, and each group has its own
permission. When a user attempts to use /want to obtain an item, their
permissions will be tested to ensure that they are permitted to ask
for an item in that group.

Packs are pre-configured sets of items. A user may use the /pack
command to give multiple different items at once.
